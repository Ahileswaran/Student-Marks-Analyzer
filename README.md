# Student-Marks-Analyzer
A C++ program to analyze student marks based on their stream and class.


C++ Application for School and Class Rank Calculation

This is a C++ console application designed to calculate the school and class ranks of A/L (Advanced Level) students based on their term test results.
Streams and Classes:

    The school offers two streams: Bioscience and Math.
    In the Bioscience stream, there are 3 classes, each consisting of 40 students.
    In the Math stream, there are 5 classes, each consisting of 40 students.

Subjects:

    Bioscience students take the following subjects: Biology, Physics, and Chemistry.
    Math students take the following subjects: Combined Maths, Physics, and Chemistry.

Functional Requirements:

    The application should be implemented as a console application.

    No graphical user interface (GUI) is required for this exercise.

    The application should have the capability to store marks per student per subject in file(s) for future reference.

    When the calculate function of the application is called, it should:
        Calculate the total marks of each student based on their performance in the subjects.
        Rank the students according to their total marks.

    The application should provide the following information for each student:
        School rank: The overall rank of the student among all the students in the school.
        Class rank: The rank of the student within their respective class.

    The calculated school and class ranks for each student should be printed to the console and also written to a file for further analysis.
